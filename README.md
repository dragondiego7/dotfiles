# Hugo does dotfiles

This is a way to personalize your system.


I made this entirely from scratch, any ideas to improve this are welcome but I feel free to not accepted them since this is for my needs.

# Content
I was presented with this amazing idea and wanted to do part of it.

So there it's, my dotfiles with constant updates.

* Updates your system
* Install, updates and configures some packages
* Alias
* Cronjobs
* Notifications

# Install

```
git clone ->repo<-
change args.sh to whatever is your needs.
run install.sh and wait for the magic to happen.
```
If you had any trouble with this project, please [open an issue](https://github.com/hugofree17/dotfiles/issues) so I can fix it. :)
